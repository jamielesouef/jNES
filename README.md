# jNES

This is a personal project just to learn about how the NES works. Not intended to be a faithful emulator. 

The current 6502 emulator passes nestest.rom with a few exceptions. PPU cycles have been removed and a few instructions are skipped that deal with memory mapping between the CPU and PUU.
